Iâ€™ve created an interactive sales dashboard using Power BI to visualize and analyze sales performance. First, I cleaned and prepared the dataset, converting key columns like Order.Date and Ship.Date to the appropriate datetime format and creating a new Month-Year column to facilitate time-based analysis. The dataset was then imported into Power BI, where I built a range of visualizations to present the sales data effectively. These include a Line Chart to track sales trends over time, a Bar Chart to compare sales by region, and a Donut Chart to show sales distribution across categories. I also added slicers for user interactivity, allowing filtering by region or category. Additionally, I implemented color coding to highlight top-performing areas. To make the report more accessible, I added a prominent title "Sales Performance Dashboard" and individual titles for each visual, ensuring a clear understanding of the insights being presented. The dashboard is now ready to provide valuable business insights into sales performance and trends.
